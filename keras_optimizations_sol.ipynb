    "## Network Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the first question that we will think of when building networks through Tensorflow is \"how big should it be\"? This is a very big question, and one of those ones without a real answer. We can put some guidelines in place to help us though. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does the Size Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of a neural network is also known as the capacity. We can relate it roughly to the size of our first model, the tree. The larger a network is the higher its capacity to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Size to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start with a few guidelines to have a reasonably sized neural network. These steps do not ensure an optimal solution, but they'll get us started. There really is not a prescribed method for calculating the optimal network size (beleive me, I've looked), but there are several rules of thumb we can build together:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Start with an input layer that is either\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> The width of the data, if the feature set is relatively small. \n",
    "    <li> A reasonably large number if the feature set is large. \n",
    "    <li> We don't have a true diving line, but 512 is a reasonable value to try for an upper end, at least at first. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Add 1 or 2 hidden layers of the same size and observe the results. We want to keep the model smaller if making it larger doesn't improve things, so first we shoudl see how good of a job a small model does. If the data is very large, skipping past the 1 layer step may save some time since we can predict that we can do better with a larger model in advance. \n",
    "<li> Increase layers of the same size until we get some overfitting and the training loss flattens. We want to reach the point where the model is getting to be excellent at predicting the training data. This is something we can see in the plot by noticing that the validation loss flatlines or starts to get worse. The training loss flattening is an indication that the model is not getting any better at learning the training data; we can use early stopping with a loose patience setting on training loss and lots of epochs to find this. \n",
    "<li> Add regularization steps to cut down that overfitting. We can try regularization and dropouts to cut down on that overfitting. We probably want to try a few options, parameters, and combinations here, there's not really a way to know in advance which regularization will work best on our data. \n",
    "<li> \"Funnel\" the layer size, potentially adding more layers. The traditional configuration of layers is to gradually decrease the size from the input layer towards the output layer. There is open debate on if this is better than having layers that are all the same size. We can play with this a little to see if results improve or not. \n",
    "<li> Use pruning. Much like a tree we can prune back a model to fight overfitting. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height vs Width\n",
    "\n",
    "Another begged question is should we make networks wider (more neurons) or deeper (more layers)? Once again, there's no universal answer, but the general evidence leans towards more layers. There are several reasons for this, none of them definitive, but taken as a whole they add up to a strong case:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Ability to learn different representation of the data - this will be more clear next time when we start to look at some image specific neural networks, but one of the cool features of neural networks is that at each layer the network \"sees\" a different representation of the data, as it goes through each round of transformations. This has the effect of allowing it to identify different features at each layer, and use those features to make more and more accurate predictions. We'll examine this more soon. \n",
    "<li> Avoiding overfitting - extremely wide neural networks tend towards overfitting the training data and not generalizing as well to new data. \n",
    "<li> Ability to add interim steps - with a multi layer network we can add multiple steps such as regularization or dropouts, again to fight overfitting. \n",
    "<li> Automatic feature selection - deep neural networks will automatically perform a type of feature selection as the least important features are minimized in their importance. This is an emerging area of research - some people have argued that well designed neural networks can remove the need for feature selection, and neural networks are being created to be feature selection tools. We can see this illustrated most clearly with images again, we feed a network an entire image, and get a prediction. Note that this isn't a total rejection of feature selection for neural networks, improving the feature set will impact neural network models just as it will for ordinary models; with neural networks we just have the potential for the network to \"cover for mistakes\" in the features. This is more dramatic as data size and network size increase. \n",
    "<li> Results - deep learning has become a common term recently for a reason, due to the success of deep neural networks with many layers. Most of the cool stuff that we see coming from AI such as image recognition, translation, and self navigating robots are the result of deep learning networks. In practice these networks have tended to outperform shallower ones, especially in more complex tasks. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not make a model that is both very wide and very deep? This will tend to overfit as it can \"memorize\" the training data. With large datasets we do see very large models in some cases, since the more data we have, the more fitting we can handle. "

    "Batch size determines how many records are processed before the gradients are updated - i.e. the number of records between one forward and backwards pass.\n",

    "The batch sizes are a matter of very open debate for the optimal solution. At the high end, batch sizes are limited by what can fit in memory. When dealing with very large data this may matter as a batch that is a small fraction of the data may be a massive absolute size. At the lower end using smaller batches gives the same effect as it does when we looked at regular gradient descent - the gradients become less stable as we are relying on a smaller number of records. In reading more about batch sizes I want to update my recommendation to be even smaller than the 50 to 150 I suggested before, down to <100, even as small as into the single digits. There is research that smaller batch sizes tend to produce models that generalize better than ones with larger batches. \n",

    "Dont' stress too much on batch size, this is really something that needs to be grid searched to find a great answer. "

    "Of all options the optimizer is the one we will care about the least. Each different optimizer is a different algorithm for doing the gradient descent. The optimizers have different results with respect to speed, memory usage, computational expense, and likelyhood to get stuck in a local minima. \n",

    "Adam is a good compromise between all factors and is very commonly used. We'll just use this for our work. One other common one is RMSprop, if you're feeling spicy, give that a try and see if there are any imporvements. "

    "To combat the dying ReLU problem there are a couple of other activation functions that avoid that issue - Leaky ReLU and ELU. Each one changes the negative values to something other than 0 - Leaky ReLU uses a slight linear gradient, ELU uses an exponential function for a similar, but curved, slight gradient. "
